In this project I wanted to dig into the classic Titanic dataset in my own way, trying to get new insights.

**Bootstrapping Titanic**
I used Decision Tree model, but wanted to go further and built function to bootstrap dataset to be able to create multiple models within one set.

Using loop, I was able to create great number of models, and then found which one had the best test score.

**TitanAnalysis**
Here I wanted to use new skill of pruning Decision Tree and compared it with Logistic Regression.
